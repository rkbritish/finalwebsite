              <h3>Trekking</h3>
              <p>Nepal has attracted trekkers from around the world since the 1960s when Col Jimmy Robert's organized the first commercial trek.
                   Trekking has been the leading activity of tourists in Nepal and thousands take to the Himalayas, some doing a few days of 
                   hiking while others take on a month long trek through valleys and high mountain passes. Two of the most popular treking regions
                    are the Everest and Annapurna where many different trails can be followed while the other popuar treks are in the Langtang and
                     Kanchenjunga regions. The most challenging is the Great Himalayan Trails, an extensive trail system that covers Nepal from
                      Humla and Darchula in the west to Kanchenjunga in the east. The diversity of trekking trails in Nepal cannot be found 
                      in any other part of the world. </p>
