    <p>   Dr. Leonard Leakey Hofstadter, Ph.D., is an experimental<br> physicist at the California Institute of Technology who<br> formerly roomed with Sheldon Cooper in Apartment<br>  4Aand now he and his wife Penny live in that apartment<br> and they also formerly lived in Penny's apartment Apartment 4B. <br>Along with Sheldon, he is the main male protagonist.<br> Originally from New Jersey, Leonard attended Princeton University<br> and was twenty-four years old when he received his doctorate with a <br>Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.<br> Having lived with Sheldon for ten years as of Season 6,<br> he and Leonard are best friends; however, Leonard can become very agitated<br> by many of his eccentricities and often feels obligated <br>to explain Sheldon's behavior and serve as a mediator between him<br> and other people in situations â€“ he has been described as<br> the straight man of the series. While Leonard,<br> along with his geek friends and fellow scientists, is somewhat socially inept,<br> Leonard would like to be better accepted outside of his social group.<br> Leonard is better-adjusted than his companions,<br> being more willing to try different things. He appears to be best suited as<br> a leader of the group, with Sheldon commenting how <br>Leonard is the "Kirk" of their landing party.<br>  The romance between him and neighbor Penny,<br> with their on-and-off relationship has been the major <br> force for drama until Shamy started.</p>
