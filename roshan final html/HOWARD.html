    <p>   Howard Joel Wolowitz, M.Eng., is a Jewish aerospace engineer<br> and ex-astronaut.<br> He is the son of an overbearing mother, Debbie Wolowitz,<br> who couldn't care less about his scientific accomplishments<br> and still talks to him as if he were a child.<br> As the best friend of Rajesh Koothrappali,<br> Howard often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment with him.<br> Although he's the only member of the group lacking a doctoral degree,<br> he defends himself by pointing out that he not only<br> has a Master's degree in Engineering from MIT,<br> but also designs important devices like the "space toilet"<br> and telescope used at the International Space Station<br> and components for satellites and space probes.<br> Fancying himself a smooth ladies' man,<br> Howard is rather confident in trying to woo girls (unlike the other three),<br> mostly through creepy overtures and sometimes with his knowledge <br>of foreign languages, of which he knows seven (if you count Klingon).<br> During the show, he dates and eventually marries Bernadette,<br> with whom he bonded over their dislike <br>towards their overbearing mothers and has been influenced<br> to tone down his creepy behavior.<br> Much later, the couple have a daughter named Halley Wolowitz<br> and a son named Neil Michael Wolowitz.</p>
