    <p>   Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper, B.S., M.S., M.A., Ph.D.,<br> Sc.D., is a Caltech theoretical physicist.<br> Along with his best friend, Leonard Hofstadter,<br>he is the main male protagonist. Originally from <br>East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11,<br> receiving his first Ph.D. at the age of 16. As a kid,<br> Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments<br> as a "wunderkind", such as his plan to provide<br> free electricity for his hometown by building a nuclear<br> reactor - a plan stopped by government pen pushers claiming<br> it's illegal to store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed.<br> Proudly geeky, he has no qualms about speaking Klingon,<br> wearing vintage t-shirts sporting superhero logos,<br> or spouting various historical and cultural anecdotes<br> (e.g., his account of the introduction of the fork into Thailand).<br> While he might claim to be the perfect human specimen,<br> Sheldon does have his faults. Sheldon is characterized<br> by a strict adherence to routine and hygiene;<br> an overly intellectual personality;<br> a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor;<br> and a general lack of humility or empathy,<br> the former of which is demonstrated in the fact that he has no problem<br> voicing to his peers his admiration for his superior intellect.<br> These qualities, along with his penchant for pranks,<br> are his character's main source of humor. He is often<br> considered to be the most iconic character of the show.<br> Sheldon has developed a more human personality due to the influences<br> of his friend Penny and his wife Amy, but some of it does not always show up.<br> Although it is never stated, it is widely theorized that<br> Sheldon has Asperger's Syndrome.</p>
