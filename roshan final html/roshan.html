    <p>   Dr. Rajesh Ramayan "Raj" Koothrappali, Ph.D.,<br> is an astrophysicist and Howard Wolowitz's best friend.<br> He often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment,<br> though he has his own apartment (the Raj Mahal) in Pasadena.<br> Raj fell in love with astronomy while attending Cambridge University.<br> Originally from New Delhi, Raj has an Indian English accent and,<br> ironically, dislikes Indian food and culture. <br>He frequently portrays himself as having come from humble origins<br> and growing up in poverty in India, <br>only for his friends to remind him that his father is a gynecologist,<br> drives a Bentley, and has a house full of servants.<br> For the first six seasons, his principal characteristic <br>was a case of selective mutism social anxiety disorder,<br> which did not allow him to talk to women outside of his family.<br> This condition could be suppressed through alcohol <br>(or if he thought he was drinking alcohol) or experimental social anxiety medications;<br> however, the former usually ended up changing his personality,<br> making him more obnoxious and overbearing,<br> while the latter tended to have unpredictable side-effects.</p>
