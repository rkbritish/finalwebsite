                        <h2>Founder</h2>
                        <p><i>"The real workout starts when you want to stop".</i><br> I am a founder of fitness factory. It was established in order to help those skinny peoples who are trying put on some real mass. <br> And
to help out those fat peoples who are trying to get in fit position. Here we help genuinely to make their dream comes true.“The majority of people think bodybuilders are ‘mass monsters’, and generally not very healthy-looking people,” Terry explains. “But it’s really anyone who is trying to build or sculpt their body.”

If you want to get serious about bodybuilding, you’ll need to navigate your nutrition and training with military precision. Your regime will differ wildly if you’re gunning for gains (bulking) vs shredding fat (cutting) 12 weeks out from a competition. Needless to say, there’s not much room for a Friday night pint in either of these.

Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, this is going to be tough, but it's achievable.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">How bodybuilding changed my life?</h2>
<p style="margin:20px 20px;">I was a shy, skinny lad who lacked confidence and poise.<br><br>
But what a difference two years in the gym made. Now im a five nine footer with an eye on competing in Asian bodybuilding contests.<br><br>
And my message is entirely positive, stressing the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and the differences it can make.I was born in Kathmandu,now 21.<br> <br><br>
As a teenager i was awkward and shy. An introduction to bodybuilding changed my life completely.“When I started working out it was about the look,”
“Then it became a passion. <br><br>But it’s not just about aesthetics. It’s about the mindset and making you a better person. Before I started working out I weighed 41 kilos and 5ft 2ins. Now I’m 74 kilos and 5.9ft.”</p>

<p style="margin:20px 20px;">I think the discipline i applied to my life helped me gain. Im now at college studying Bsc.it levels.<br>
I train in my own fitness factory and has ambitions to enter bodybuilding competitions.<br>
<br>Bodybuilder "Alex Larkin" claims Miss Universe title - only a year after joining gym

“When it comes to training there can be too much. If you do it right you should take a few days off for your body to recover. It never became obsessive for me. I don’t want to be Mr Olympia. That’s too much.

“I just want to be natural and healthy, to be a better person and to have a good physique.”
